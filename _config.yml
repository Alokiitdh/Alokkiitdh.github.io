  Hi, my name’s Alok and I’m an AI Engineer. I recently completed my M.Tech. in Communication Signal Processing and Machine Learning from IIT Dharwad, where I focused on machine learning and deep learning.

  I have experience building intelligent multi-agent systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and LLMs. I’ve developed production-ready APIs with FastAPI, integrated external tools like web search, and worked with vector databases like FAISS and Pinecone for efficient semantic retrieval. I’ve also worked on advanced RAG pipelines, implemented real-time object tracking and counting systems, and built generative and classification models using CNNs, Vision Transformers, and diffusion techniques.

  Along the way, I’ve gained strong problem-solving, debugging, and collaboration skills, and I’m passionate about building real-world AI applications.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          Building intelligent systems with LangGraph, FastAPI, and LLMs to solve real-world AI challenges—one agent at a time.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I have designed and evaluated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using LangGraph, LangChain, and LLMs, with performance benchmarking through RAGAS. My work includes building agentic workflows using LangGraph and leveraging LangSmith for tracing, debugging, and automating complex, multi-step behaviors.

            I’ve developed production-ready APIs using FastAPI, integrated external tools like web search into multi-agent systems, and utilized CLI tools to streamline and automate development workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of infrastructure, intelligence, and innovation to bring powerful AI products to life.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
