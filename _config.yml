  Hi, my name’s Alok and I’m an AI Engineer. I have completed my M.Tech. in Communication Signal Processing and Machine Learning from IIT Dharwad, where I focused on machine learning and deep learning.

  I have experience building intelligent multi-agent systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and LLMs. I’ve developed production-ready APIs with FastAPI, integrated external tools like web search, and worked with vector databases like FAISS and Pinecone for efficient semantic retrieval. I’ve also worked on advanced RAG pipelines, implemented real-time object tracking and counting systems, and built generative and classification models using CNNs, Vision Transformers, and diffusion techniques.

  Along the way, I’ve gained strong problem-solving, debugging, and collaboration skills, and I’m passionate about building real-world AI applications.

            I have designed and evaluated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using LangGraph, LangChain, and LLMs, with performance benchmarking through RAGAS. My work includes building agentic workflows using LangGraph and leveraging LangSmith for tracing, debugging, and automating complex, multi-step behaviors.

            I’ve developed production-ready APIs using FastAPI, integrated external tools like web search into multi-agent systems, and utilized CLI tools to streamline and automate development workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of infrastructure, intelligence, and innovation to bring powerful AI products to life.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at IIT Dharwad, I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and signal processing. The program provided both theoretical depth and practical exposure, allowing me to work on real-world projects involving generative AI, vision transformers, and diffusion models.

          I also gained experience in research-driven development, time-bound problem solving, and collaborative teamwork—all of which shaped my journey as an AI engineer.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I developed strong fundamentals in mathematics, signal processing, and embedded systems. This is where I was first introduced to programming, machine learning, and computer vision, which later evolved into my core areas of interest. I actively participated in technical events and projects, laying the groundwork for my future in AI.

          A smart interview tool that asks questions, checks your answers, and gives feedback and a final score – all through a simple chat in your terminal.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I built an AI-powered technical interviewer using a command-line interface (CLI). The system simulates a real interview by dynamically generating open-ended technical questions on a chosen topic (like Machine Learning, Networks, etc.), accepting user responses, and evaluating them with structured scoring and feedback. The project is built using LangGraph and OpenAI's GPT-4.1, and follows a multi-agent design with three core agents: the question_agent crafts theoretical questions, the evaluation_agent scores user answers based on clarity, depth, and accuracy, and the performance_agent compiles the final score and a concise performance summary. The architecture supports checkpointing, in-memory state tracking, and modular extensibility for future deployment via FastAPI or web interfaces. This project helped me explore advanced LLM workflows, prompt engineering, and the design of agent-based interview systems. It serves as a practical tool for technical interview practice and showcases how LLMs can be orchestrated in real-world applications.
